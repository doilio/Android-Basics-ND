## Project 2: [Score Keeper Application](https://github.com/doilio/Android-Basics-ND/tree/master/ScoreKeeper)   
## Project Overview
 > In this project, you will need to build a Score Keeper app. You will need to select a sport or game to track. Importantly, you'll need to select a sport with either multiple ways to score points or multiple metrics to track.
 ## Requirements
If you have trouble choosing, here are some suggestions:
* Baseball Scores App: Track both runs and outs
    * American Football Scores App: Add a button for each of the 4 amounts of points a team can score in american football.
    * Football Scores app: Track both points and fouls

## Project 3: [Quizz App](https://github.com/doilio/Android-Basics-ND/tree/master/QuizApp)   
## Project Overview
 > The Quiz App project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making your own Android app - taking it from the idea stage to building out the full app. You can share your app with family and friends, as well as with other students in this course.
 ## Requirements
Per the rubric, we require a minimum of:
* 4 questions and a maximum of 10 quiz questions for a proper app submission
* App containing 4 - 10 questions, including at least one check box, one radio button, and one text entry.

## Project 4: [Musical Structure Application](https://github.com/doilio/Android-Basics-ND/tree/master/MusicalStructure)   
## Project Overview
 > This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned so far in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making the structure of a music app using Intents, New Activities, Arraylists, Loops and Custom Classes.
 The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app. Note that for this project, the app does not actually need to play music.
 ## Requirements
The required components for this project are:
* 2 to 6 Activities that are linked via explicit intents
* A custom class storing information about each song. Each instance of the custom class must contain at least 2 states (e.g. Song Name, Artist Name). Images (e.g. Album Art) are not required but allowed.
* A data structure, such as an ArrayList that would store Instances of the custom class. These instances should be retrieved and displayed in a ListView or GridView via an Adapter.

## Project 5: [Tour Guide Application](https://github.com/doilio/Android-Basics-ND/tree/master/TourGuide) 
## Project Overview
 > The goal is to create a Tour Guide App which presents relevant information to a user who’s visiting your city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city. It can contain all the best known secrets that only locals know. It’s up to you which categories you want to provide, as well as what information to provide in each category.
 ## Requirements
The required components for this project are:
* App contains at least 4 lists of relevant attractions for a location
* User navigates between lists in Fragments using either a Navigation Drawer or a ViewPager plus TabLayout.
* Each list item contains information about an event, restaurant, historical site, or similar.
* At least one list includes pictures of the location.
* The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
    * Text sizes are defined in sp
    * Lengths are defined in dp
    * Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.
