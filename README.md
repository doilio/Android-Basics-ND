 ## Requirements
Your design must include: 
* Business name.
* At least one photo representing the business.
* Two or more other pieces of information, such as:
    * Contact information for the business (eg phone number, email address, website).

## Project 2: [Score Keeper Application](https://github.com/doilio/Android-Basics-ND/tree/master/ScoreKeeper)   
## Project Overview
 > In this project, you will need to build a Score Keeper app. You will need to select a sport or game to track. Importantly, you'll need to select a sport with either multiple ways to score points or multiple metrics to track.
 ## Requirements
If you have trouble choosing, here are some suggestions:
* Baseball Scores App: Track both runs and outs
    * American Football Scores App: Add a button for each of the 4 amounts of points a team can score in american football.
    * Football Scores app: Track both points and fouls

## Project 3: [Quizz App](https://github.com/doilio/Android-Basics-ND/tree/master/QuizApp)   
## Project Overview
 > The Quiz App project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making your own Android app - taking it from the idea stage to building out the full app. You can share your app with family and friends, as well as with other students in this course.
 ## Requirements
Per the rubric, we require a minimum of:
* 4 questions and a maximum of 10 quiz questions for a proper app submission
* App containing 4 - 10 questions, including at least one check box, one radio button, and one text entry.

## Project 4: [Musical Structure Application](https://github.com/doilio/Android-Basics-ND/tree/master/MusicalStructure)   
## Project Overview
 > This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned so far in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making the structure of a music app using Intents, New Activities, Arraylists, Loops and Custom Classes.
 The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app. Note that for this project, the app does not actually need to play music.
 ## Requirements
The required components for this project are:
* 2 to 6 Activities that are linked via explicit intents
* A custom class storing information about each song. Each instance of the custom class must contain at least 2 states (e.g. Song Name, Artist Name). Images (e.g. Album Art) are not required but allowed.
* A data structure, such as an ArrayList that would store Instances of the custom class. These instances should be retrieved and displayed in a ListView or GridView via an Adapter.
