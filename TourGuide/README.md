## Project 5: Tour Guide Application 
## Project Overview
 > The goal is to create a Tour Guide App which presents relevant information to a user who’s visiting your city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city. It can contain all the best known secrets that only locals know. It’s up to you which categories you want to provide, as well as what information to provide in each category.
 ## Requirements
The required components for this project are:
* App contains at least 4 lists of relevant attractions for a location
* User navigates between lists in Fragments using either a Navigation Drawer or a ViewPager plus TabLayout.
* Each list item contains information about an event, restaurant, historical site, or similar.
* At least one list includes pictures of the location.
* The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
    * Text sizes are defined in sp
    * Lengths are defined in dp
    * Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.
